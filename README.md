# Packstack

Packstack is a gear management system and packing list builder for backpackers and outdoor enthusiasts. The UI is built with React, Typescript and Vite.

### Getting started

First, set up your local env variables

Create `.env.local` and add the follow:

```

_*Note:*_ Once the server is dockerized, documentation will be added for setting up the backend and database locally.

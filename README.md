# Get Started

Packstack is built with React, Typescript and Vite

### Environment variables

First, set up your local env variables

Create `.env.local` and add the follow:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://api.packstack.io
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=
```

_*Note:*_ Once the server is dockerized, documentation will be added for setting up the backend and database locally.

### Start the development server

`npm i`
`npm run dev`
